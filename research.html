<p>Research in the Hohenlohe Lab addresses basic questions in evolutionary genetics and genomics from both theoretical and empirical 
perspectives, and also applies genomic tools to conservation of threatened species.</p>

<p>Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is a powerful tool for using next-generation sequencing to scan across the 
genomes of scores to hundreds of individuals from natural populations.  The lab is involved both in using this technique to generate 
data, and in developing statistical and analytical tools for RADseq data.  Members of the lab are applying RADseq in collaborative 
projects involving threespine stickleback, cutthroat trout, disease-vector mosquitoes, wolves, Channel Island foxes, oak-wilt fungi, 
anoles, and cane toads.  The goals of these projects range from determining basic demographic features, like population size and 
phylogeography, to estimating patterns of genetic diversity, detecting selection and mapping behavioral and morphological traits. </p>

</a>Experimental population genomics</h4>

<p>The explosion of population genomic data from non-model organisms, made possible by techniques like RADseq, has outstripped our understanding of 
genomic evolution and our ability to make sense of the data.  To bridge this gap, we are combining experimental evolution in yeast with 
next-generation sequencing.  Here we can control population sizes, migration rates, strengths of selection, recombination rates, and 
amount and structure of standing genetic variation in replicated experiments, and observe the results of evolution at the genomic 
sequence level.  The goal is to improve our powers of inference about natural populations from population genomic data.  </p>
